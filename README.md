### Adding New Document Files

When you add a new Markdown file to the documentation, follow these steps to ensure it is properly integrated and displayed:

1. **Add the Markdown file**:
    - Place your new Markdown file in the `docs/` directory.

2. **Update `mkdocs.yml`**:
    - Open the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.
    - Add an entry for your new Markdown file under the `nav` section to include it in the navigation.

    Example:
    ```yaml
    nav:
      - Home: index.md
      - New Page: new_page.md
    ```
